**Description:**
This project can be distributed freely, and can also be used for, in general, most non-commercial activities. It is a game about avoiding as many asteroids as possible without having your hp dip to 0. 



**Dependencies: **
The only dependency is pygame, simply install it and run!


**Installing:**
you can download it on this repository, otherwise, you can DM me and I'll send you a .py file
So far, no modifications need to be made to files/folders


**Executing program:**
click "play"
that's about it, if you don't see the program after clicking play, then you can Alt Tab into the program window. 


**Help:**
there shouldn't be any big issues, if there are, DM me @tim.shi25@bcp.org
